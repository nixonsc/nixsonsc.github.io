I am an economist and political scientist and currently a Graduate Student in Political Science at Texas Tech University. I am also a Distinguished Graduate Student Fellow and Teaching Assistant in Political Science at Texas Tech. My research program focuses on international relations, comparative, political methodology, migration, macroeconomics and microfinance primarily in African countries. I received my MS in agricultural and applied economics from Texas Tech where I was a Graduate Research and Teaching Assistant and Vice President for the Agricultural Economics Graduate Student Association. My Bcom in economics is from Midlands State University.
